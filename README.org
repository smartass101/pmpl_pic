*** TODO return std of current
** TODO document in this README
- requirements.txt
  - numba 0.28.1
** TODO [#C] nice CLI interface for plotting and fitting V-A characteristic
** TODO [#C] make nicer particle container classes
- some slicing support to factor out that ugly thing

** TODO [#C] merge CIC weighting with other functions
** TODO [#C] physical scales as input
- n_e -> N
- macroparticles as fraction of requirement for n_e
